2. **API Project Setup**: Clone this repository and set up a new .NET Core Web API project. Connect the API to the database, and apply dependency injection.

3. **Functionality**: Implement customer, order, and product management functionality according to the specified requirements. Build GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods for each entity.

4. **Security**: Implement authentication to restrict access to the API. Ensure no credentials are stored on GitHub.

5. **Web API Cloud Hosting**: Create an API service connected to an F1 tier (free) service plan on Azure. Publish your API to the service and ensure it is secure and accessible.

6. **Project Documentation**: The `docs/` directory contains important project documentation, including how to use the API, a list of all endpoints, and additional implemented aspects.


# Project 3 Repository 

Welcome to the CMPG 323 Project 3 repository! This project focuses on developing a specialized API that efficiently manages data related to orders, customers, and products. The API is designed using the latest .NET Core technology and leverages Azure services for secure data storage and access.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` directory: Contains the source code for the specialized API project.
- `docs/` directory: Includes important project documentation and related files.

## Getting Started

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**: Start by creating a new repository named 'CMPG 323 Project 3 - <your-student-number>' and add a descriptive `ReadMe.md` file to introduce your project.

2. **Project Progress**: Regularly commit and push your solution to the source control throughout the development process. Keep the GitHub project updated iteratively to showcase the progression of your project.

3. **Project Setup**: Fork the existing GitHub repository and create a new development branch. Connect the Web App to the designated data source by adding the connection string to the `appsettings.json` file.

4. **Design Pattern Implementation**: Develop repository classes that will manage data access operations for orders, customers, and products. Transfer relevant data access operations from the controllers to these repository classes.

5. **Implement Repository Classes**: Implement the usage of the repository classes in the respective controllers to replace transferred data access operations.

6. **Security**: Ensure that no sensitive credentials are stored within the repository, maintaining the security of your project.

7. **Web API Cloud Hosting**: Create an App Service connected to an F1 tier (free) service plan on Azure. Publish your App to the service, making sure it's secure and accessible to users.

8. **Project Documentation**: Detail how users can interact with your App in the `ReadMe.md` file. Additionally, compile a list of all visited sites used for the project in a reference list document.


# CMPG 323 Project 4 Repository R
